Full-Stack Machine Learning Project: Predicting Excessive Absenteeism

This project is a comprehensive end-to-end machine learning project designed to predict the probability of an individual being excessively absent (defined as being absent for 3 hours or more). The project contains the following key components:

1. Data Collection and Preparation:
    - Data Collection: Gathering relevant data such as attendance records, demographic information, work schedules, and other relevant factors that may influence absenteeism.
    - Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Cleaning the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. This includes normalizing or standardizing data, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the data into training and test sets.

2. Model Development and Training:
    - Feature Engineering: Selecting and creating relevant features that could help in predicting absenteeism.
    - Model Selection: Choosing an appropriate machine learning algorithm (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, gradient boosting, etc.).
    - Model Training: Training the model using the prepared dataset, tuning hyperparameters, and evaluating the model's performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).

3. Prediction Module:
    - Model Execution Module: Developing a module that allows the trained model to be executed on new data to make predictions. This module handles the input data, runs the model inference, and outputs the prediction results.

4. Visualization and User Interface:
    - Dashboard Development: Building an interactive dashboard or user interface that displays the prediction results in an understandable and meaningful way. This may include charts, graphs, and other visual elements to illustrate the probability of absenteeism.
    - User Interaction: Allowing users to input data and receive predictions, as well as view historical data and trends related to absenteeism.
